## Introduction to PyTorch

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It is used for applications such as natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. PyTorch provides two high-level features:
- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

## Introduction to MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker.

## Define the CNN Model

We will define a simple CNN model for digit classification. The model will have the following layers:

### Convolutional Layers:

`conv1`: The first convolutional layer takes a single-channel (grayscale) image as input (in_channels=1) and produces 32 feature maps (out_channels=32) with a kernel size of 3x3. This layer aims to capture low-level features such as edges and simple textures. The effective receptive field after this layer is 3x3 pixels, with the output size remaining at 28x28 due to the absence of padding and stride set to 1.

`conv2`: The second convolutional layer takes the 32 feature maps as input and produces 64 feature maps with a kernel size of 3x3. This layer further processes the features extracted by conv1, capturing more complex patterns. Following this layer, a max pooling operation with a 2x2 window and stride of 2 halves the feature map dimensions to 13x13 and increases the effective receptive field.

`conv3`: This layer increases the depth to 128 feature maps with the same kernel size of 3x3, processing the pooled feature maps from conv2. It does not include a pooling step, so the spatial dimensions reduce slightly due to the convolution operation.

`conv4`: The fourth convolutional layer expands the feature maps to 256 using the same kernel size. It is followed by another max pooling operation, which further reduces the spatial dimensions and increases the receptive field. This layer helps the network to capture high-level features in the image.

### Fully Connected Layers:

After the series of convolutions and pooling, the feature maps are flattened into a single vector of size 4096 (256 feature maps * 4 * 4 spatial dimensions) to feed into fully connected layers.
`fc1`: The first fully connected layer reduces the dimension from 4096 to 50, allowing the network to learn a non-linear combination of the high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers.
`fc2`: The final fully connected layer further reduces the dimension from 50 to 10, corresponding to the 10 classes of digits (0-9) in the MNIST dataset.

### Activation Functions and Pooling:

The network uses ReLU activation functions after each convolutional layer to introduce non-linearity, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data.
Max pooling operations are used after conv2 and conv4 to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, effectively increasing the receptive field and reducing the computation for subsequent layers.

### Output:

The output of the network is passed through a log softmax function, which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems. It provides a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes for each input image.

## Prepare the Dataset

We will prepare the MNIST dataset by downloading the images and creating a PyTorch dataset using the `torchvision` library. We will also define a data loader to load the data in batches during training and evaluation.

### Data Augmentation:
